    <p>

        for my final id like to not create a portfolio website per se but i would like to create a website where i can put my work and also other information. By that i mean it can also be a place where i dump inofrmation about things im interested in (like my bugs, games, etc) and also create places for putting my different types of work, code for the commodore, tattoos, paintings, games etc. 
    </p>
    <p>  
        This webside would continue to bbe added to as long as i have work and interests that i would like to be housed there.

        I would like this website to be interesting enough that it could be a work of its own, i know ill be thinking about it that way, but its not necessary. 
    </p>
    <p>  

        I do want this to be a chnace to experiment with web code especially because i hope to keep woring on it for a very long time. ( there is no concrete short term goal)

        this will be one large projects consisting of many smaller projects as id like each branch of this website to hold its own.

        I want to make this project so that i have a place where I can have a concrete place where my work exists, i have really bad object permanence so when im making work that is mostly code, if i dont have a place to put it it feels like ive done nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>  
         i want to make something that is fairly easy to navigate, but isnt boring about it
 </p>
  <p>  
        im really inspired by nathalie lawhead!- alienmelon on itchio

        linking pages, more advanced css, a better grasp of js
    </p>
    <p>   
        as of right now i think i could sit down and do this project, it would take a lot of time but i think its not too far out of my skill level, some of the things im imagining doing i definitely dont know how to do, but most of it could be done
